# Travel Agency Website

This project is a static website for a fictional travel agency, created as part of the Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path.

## Project Structure

The website is composed of a single HTML file (`index.html`) and a corresponding CSS file (`styles.css`) for styling.

### HTML

The HTML file is structured into several key sections:

- Header: Contains the website logo and main navigation. The navigation is sticky, staying at the top of the page as the user scrolls. It includes links to Home, Destinations, The Team, About Us, and Contact Us.
- Hero: A large, visually striking section at the top of the page featuring the name of the company and a Call To Action (CTA) button.
- Destinations: This section presents four of the most popular destinations offered by the travel agency. Each destination is represented by a card with an image, which displays the name of the destination when hovered over.
- The Team: This section presents information about three of the company's most reputable employees. Each team member is represented by a card with an image and text information, along with a CTA button for scheduling an appointment.
- About Us: This section provides a short history of the company and its foundation.
- Local Travel Centre Finder: This section includes an input field where users can enter a postcode to find their local travel centre.
- Contact Us: This section consists of three cards. One card provides contact details, the second card features an image of one of the offices along with information about opening and closing times, and the third card offers virtual consultancy services with a CTA button.
- Footer: Contains additional contact information and copyright details.

### CSS

The CSS file provides styling for the various HTML elements, classes, and IDs. Some of the key styled components include:

- `body`: Sets the global font, color scheme, and background image.
- `.header`: Styles the header of the website, including the background color, text alignment, and padding.
- `.hero`: Styles the hero section, including the background image, display type, and other properties.
- `nav ul` and `nav ul li`: Styles the navigation menu and its items.
- `.content`: Styles the main content of the webpage, including the width, margin, and display type.
- `.footer`: Styles the footer of the webpage, including the background color, text alignment, and padding.
- `#contact-us`: Styles the contact us section of the webpage.

## Usage

To view the website, simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

## Future Improvements

- Add Hamburger Menu for mobile devices
- Add JavaScript functionality to make the website interactive.
